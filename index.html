          Hello, there fellow nerds, I'm Jason Hunter, an IT consultant from a time when RAM was measured in Kb not Gb.
          I live in God's own county of
          the Peoples Republic of Yorkshire, in His Majestyâ€™s United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland.
          I have spent over 30 years working in IT, mainly Windows based security and systems management consultancy.
          I've recently been transitioning to cloud-based technologies on the Azure stack, but this has highlighted the
          need for me to learn web development.
          So here I am, boot camping my way to web development.
