# Module-2-Challenge-Jason-Hunter

Module-2-Challenge-Jason-Hunter is a web site I built to complete Module 2 challenge. The challenge was to build a portfolio page. The purpose is to showcase my skills and talents. I probably went overboard on the design of this page but wanted to push myself and what I've learnt. This became a tussle between perfection at the cost of good enough and finishing within the deadline, I think that may have been one of the points of the challenge. I tried to be light-hearted around the content, a sense of humour can be as good a quality as technical knowledge. I did borrow some code for the burger menu, which Iâ€™ve cited in the CSS file. There are a couple of areas which need looking at:
>*	~~Accessibility~~
>*	Image sizing - the transformations get cut off due to overflow properties, but not resolved them as of yet

The rest is of the code is from researching, a lot of W3Schools reading, and trial and error, overall, I'm happy with the result and given more time I sure I would have ironed out the wrinkle, but did enjoy the challenge, but need to learn not to over engineer.

## How I went about creating the page
After downloading the source to my local repository, I opened it an reviewed it using VS Code. I then created a repository in my GitHub subscription and uploaded my first commit from my machine. From there I used the following criteria supplied to work aganist, attempting to resolve each item.

* **Technical Acceptance Criteria**
>*  When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
>*  When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
>*  When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
>*  When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
>*  When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
>*  When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

* **Deployment**
>* Application deployed at live URL.
>* Application loads with no errors.
>* Application GitHub URL submitted.
>* GitHub repository that contains application code.

* **Application Quality**
>* Application resembles (at least 90%) screenshots provided in the Challenge instructions.

* **Repository Quality**
>* Repository has a unique name.
>* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
>* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
>* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
